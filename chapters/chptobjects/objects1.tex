\chapter{Objects}
Everything in Python is an Object. That is a bold statement and what does it actually mean?

\section{inheriting}

\begin{lstlisting}
class player(person):
  pass
\end{lstlisting}
All the attributes and methods from person class but don’t want to add more –use pass
\begin{lstlisting}
class player(person): 
 def __init__(self, name): 
   super().__init__(name)

\end{lstlisting}
But now we can also add methods and attributes and over-write methods

\chapter{Basic Concepts}
\section{Introduction }
This is an opportunity to learn how to computer program for data intelligent and data science systems. How to critically apply mathematics and everyday heuristics into the fundamentals of computer programming concepts to achieve functional and useable computer application. The module learning is building block of learning to support future learning in design and development of data intelligent systems.

\begin{enumerate}[1.]
\item Python Programming (and Programming in general)
\item Applying it to problems.
\item Documenting it appropriately for Data Scientists
\item Picking up a few tools on the way
\end{enumerate}


\section{Mistakes and Errors}
You will make mistakes! We all do. The trick is to not let them stop you and learn from them.
\begin{list}
    \item 
    F First
    \item 
    A Attempt at
    \item 
    I Initial
    \item 
    L Learning
\end{list}
It might seem strange to talk about failure and mistakes this early on but actually they can stop you learning. You will make mistakes we all do, but think of it as a learning point not a disaster. Programming is one of those topics that is best learnt with an element of Trial and Error - "I know how to do this, but what happens if I change this?" or "I want to do this, so how can I do it?"
